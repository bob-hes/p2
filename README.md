<!-- Description
Want to use this, as well as use it for another project where I can,
- repopulate forms easily
- set forms easily
- check if on sessions on saved forms, and of the fields changed, instead of updating on every single field
- validate the changed fields easily


- can variable variable method call
- can set magic methods in order to privatize all the variables and thus force them to have to be validated
- optional variables
- Fatal error when trying to find Validator.php
- Want to be able for the validator to be able to grab every single element not filled in correctly, instead of stopping and throwing an exception at the first element not filled in

- Set up the Generator, Settings, Validator to fill in a later form.
- Why so complicated?
- server - rather on a file not in a directory, so as not to suggest the file structure
- easier to add new properties

- according to php the right way, and for its reputation
- found "" vs ''
